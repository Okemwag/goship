This started as a fork of [pagoda](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda), for which I am super grateful! Big shoutout to Mike Stefanello and team!

To get up and running with GoShip:
```bash
make up
make seed
make watch
```

For in-depth info on the architecture of the project, please see the [mikestefanello/pagoda](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda) repo. There are some key differences, but since this was originally a fork, 99% of it still applies. I am working on creating clear and actionable documentation, but that is quite time-consuming, so don't hold your socks.
